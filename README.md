## What is a Master Mind Group ? 
« It’s the coordination of knowledge and effort of two or more people, who work toward a definite purpose, in the spirit of harmony. »

When we listen to the advice of other smart people, who want to help you, you will be at an economic advantage.

## My 3 conditions to invest energy in this master mind
1. Be surrounded by people in different industries.
2. Attend the Master Mind Group every 1 or 2 weeks.
3. Meet once a year in person and celebrate our dedication.

Cheers!
Pascal
