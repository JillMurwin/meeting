## Regular question for our meeting

The «interviewer» ask these questions:

1. **What Are You Working On**? Nice and broad, and each member can answer with whatever they feel comfortable sharing.
2. **What Did You Learn at/since our last meeting**? Very often my groups are focused on similar goals, and lessons learnt by one member benefit all of us.
3. **What action/result are your proud of**?
4. **What Do You Need Help With**? By having a specific question on the agenda, this helps take pressure of members who want to reach out to the group for help.

## What is a Master Mind Group ? 
« It’s the coordination of knowledge and effort of two or more people, who work toward a definite purpose, in the spirit of harmony. »

When we listen to the advice of other smart people, who want to help you, you will be at an economic advantage.

## My 3 conditions to invest energy in this master mind
1. Be surrounded by people in different industries.
2. Attend the Master Mind Group every 1 or 2 weeks.
3. Meet once a year in person and celebrate our dedication.

Cheers!
Pascal
